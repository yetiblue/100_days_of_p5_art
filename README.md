# 100_days_of_p5_art
Creating 100 pieces of generative art with p5.js for design class | September - December 2021

"Pick something and stick with it for 100 days" 
"At the end you'll find that within the 100 quick projects you've made, there will be a handful that are very good"
"Much better to go for it, than to spend all of your time planning something out and never actually creating anything"
